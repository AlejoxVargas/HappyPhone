# README - Shopping Cart Modernization Project for Phone E-commerce


## Introduction
The development team will embark on the modernization of a legacy project, focused on a telephony e-commerce. The main goal is to improve the interactivity and practicality of the system, ensuring its scalability and facilitating its possible inheritance by future teams. The integration of APIs and the implementation of a shopping cart are key aspects to satisfy the client's needs and improve the user experience.

## Project Overview
The inherited project comes with a basic structure, but it requires improvements in terms of user interaction, scalability, and the integration of essential features like API consumption and a shopping cart. The client has specifically requested the integration of APIs and the implementation of a shopping cart to enhance the overall functionality of the platform.
# Stripe Payment Integration API

This repository contains the implementation of the Stripe API in the [Your Project Name] project. The Stripe API is used to handle payments and transactions related to [brief description of the project's purpose].

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm (Node.js Package Manager)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git
cd your-project-name
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Stripe Credentials

Obtain your Stripe credentials (secret key and public key) from the Stripe dashboard and set the corresponding environment variables in a `.env` file at the root of the project:

```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key
```

### 4. Run the Project

```bash
npm start
```

The server will run at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Usage

### Integration Steps

1. **Initialize Stripe:**
   In your application code, initialize Stripe with your public key.

   ```javascript
   const stripe = Stripe('your_public_key');
   ```

2. **Handle Payments:**
   Utilize the provided endpoints to handle payments. Examples can be found in the `examples` directory.

   ```javascript
   // Example: Create a Payment Intent
   const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
     amount: 1000,
     currency: 'usd',
   });
   ```

   Make sure to securely handle and pass the client secret to the frontend for confirmation.

3. **Webhooks:**
   If needed, set up webhook endpoints to handle events like payment confirmation or disputes.

   ```javascript
   // Example: Handle a Payment Intent confirmation webhook
   app.post('/webhooks/payment_intent_confirmation', (req, res) => {
     // Handle the event and update your application accordingly
     const event = req.body;
     // ...
     res.status(200).end();
   });
   ```
